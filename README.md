## EventSite

Replace all the database details in every file, and add custom fields if your events will have more. It should work out of the box


## EventsBot

For events bot to work, there should be some database with a table 'events' that's given to it. Then, just run it on some dedicated system by replacing the arguments in buildandrun.sh, and no ports need to be opened.
